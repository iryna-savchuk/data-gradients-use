Computer Vision dataset analysis with DataGradients.

[DataGradients](https://github.com/Deci-AI/data-gradients) is an open-source Python library for Computer Vision dataset analysis. 
Using DataGradients, you can assess image attributes (color distribution, brightness, and dimensions), examine metrics of the object detection datasets (such as bounding box area, intersection, and class occurrence), and gain insights into segmentation datasets.

In this notebook, I am profiling some benchmark CV datasets with the help of DataGradients.
